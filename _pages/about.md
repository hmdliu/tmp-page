I'm a rising senior at NYU Shanghai. My major is Computer Science, and I also minor in Mathematics. Academic research has brought me a lot of fun, so I'm likely to pursue a PhD degree after graduation.

My research interests are broadly in the <font color="FFA500">Computer Vision</font> field. Recent research topics includes semantic segmentation, few-shot segmentation, and structural re-parameterization.
